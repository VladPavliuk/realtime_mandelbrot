Realtime time mandelbrot set rendering.

To navigate use mouse dragging.
To zoom use mouse scroll. 
Q - zoom out
W - zoom in

To change constant value for formula `F1 = F0^2 + C`, use CTRL + mouse dragging (red rectangle will change the possition).

Use Up/Down/Left/Right arrows to slightlly change constant value (depends on the current zoom to avoid rapid changes to the fractal)
